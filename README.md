# Project Builds
 the builds for all my github projects
 
for my Unity Input Tool build is not included because a build wouldn't show anything about the tool.

for VR Multiplayer Project to get the full experience two computers, two vive headsets, and 4 vive trackers are needed. the computer with the trackers needs to be the first one to run and get into the playing scene. Note: due to time constraints the animated texture for the pyramid was not properly compressed and due to it's size that file of the build could not be added to GitHub even through the large file system they have. it also may have broken other things, so I suggest you build the project to play it.

for AR Rockwell Project at the time of me leaving the project due to me graduating there was no PC build because the project is intended for the Hololens 2.
